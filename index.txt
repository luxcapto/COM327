Background

I've been excited about technology for as long as I can remember and have been working on everything from graphic design to designing circuits boards to administering Linux servers. I share a fascination with not just technology but also business and creating awesome products and services. I have therefore chosen to study Business Administration at IIT. At the same time,  I am always learning about electronics, programming, information technology, and just about anything else that has a tangent to technology or business.
