    <h1>Backgrounds &amp; Ambitions</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I've been excited about technology for as long as I can remember and have been working on everything from graphic design to designing circuits boards to administering Linux servers. I share a fascination with not just technology but also business and creating awesome products and services. I have therefore chosen to study Business Administration at IIT. At the same time,  I am always learning about electronics, programming, information technology, and just about anything else that has a tangent to technology or business.</p>
    <h2>Ambitions for this class</h2>
    <p>In this class I would like to get a more official grip on using Git as well as creating websites without utilizing frameworks such as Bootstrap. Given my previous experience with web development, I would also like to devote more time to not just creating a website that works but also one that is delightful to use and delightful to look at.</p>
    <h2>Ambitions for career</h2>
    <p>I ideally see myself as a project or product manager in a techonology-focused company. For me, a project manager's job is to bring together the various stakeholders (users, designers, engineers, etc) of a project together and create an awesome solution.</p>
